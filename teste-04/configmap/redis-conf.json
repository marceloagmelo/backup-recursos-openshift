Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of\n# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.\n#\n# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to\n#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least\n#    a given number of slaves.\n# 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the\n#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of\n#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next\n#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.\n# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a\n#    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters\n#    and resynchronize with them.\n#\n# slaveof \u003cmasterip\u003e \u003cmasterport\u003e\n\n# If the master is password protected (using the \"requirepass\" configuration\n# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before\n# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will\n# refuse the slave request.\n#\n# masterauth \u003cmaster-password\u003e\n\n# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication\n# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:\n#\n# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will\n#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the\n#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.\n#\n# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with\n#    an error \"SYNC with master in progress\" to all the kind of commands\n#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.\n#\nslave-serve-stale-data yes\n\n# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against\n# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data\n# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but\n# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a\n# misconfiguration.\n#\n# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.\n#\n# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients\n# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.\n# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands\n# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve\n# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the\n# administrative / dangerous commands.\nslave-read-only yes\n\n# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.\n#\n# -------------------------------------------------------\n# WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY\n# -------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication\n# process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a \"full\n# synchronization\". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.\n# The transmission can happen in two different ways:\n#\n# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB\n#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent\n#                 process to the slaves incrementally.\n# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the\n#              RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.\n#\n# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves\n# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing\n# the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once\n# the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer\n# will start when the current one terminates.\n#\n# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of\n# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves\n# will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.\n#\n# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication\n# works better.\nrepl-diskless-sync no\n\n# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay\n# the server waits in order to spawn the child that trnasfers the RDB via socket\n# to the slaves.\n#\n# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve\n# new slaves arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server\n# waits a delay in order to let more slaves arrive.\n#\n# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable\n# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.\nrepl-diskless-sync-delay 5\n\n# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change\n# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10\n# seconds.\n#\n# repl-ping-slave-period 10\n\n# The following option sets the replication timeout for:\n#\n# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of slave.\n# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of slaves (data, pings).\n# 3) Slave timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).\n#\n# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value\n# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected\n# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.\n#\n# repl-timeout 60\n\n# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?\n#\n# If you select \"yes\" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and\n# less bandwidth to send data to slaves. But this can add a delay for\n# the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with\n# Linux kernels using a default configuration.\n#\n# If you select \"no\" the delay for data to appear on the slave side will\n# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.\n#\n# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions\n# or when the master and slaves are many hops away, turning this to \"yes\" may\n# be a good idea.\nrepl-disable-tcp-nodelay no\n\n# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates\n# slave data when slaves are disconnected for some time, so that when a slave\n# wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial\n# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while\n# disconnected.\n#\n# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the slave can be\n# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.\n#\n# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a slave connected.\n#\n# repl-backlog-size 1mb\n\n# After a master has no longer connected slaves for some time, the backlog\n# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that\n# need to elapse, starting from the time the last slave disconnected, for\n# the backlog buffer to be freed.\n#\n# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.\n#\n# repl-backlog-ttl 3600\n\n# The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.\n# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a\n# master if the master is no longer working correctly.\n#\n# A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so\n# for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will\n# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.\n#\n# However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the\n# role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by\n# Redis Sentinel for promotion.\n#\n# By default the priority is 100.\nslave-priority 100\n\n# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than\n# N slaves connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.\n#\n# The N slaves need to be in \"online\" state.\n#\n# The lag in seconds, that must be \u003c= the specified value, is calculated from\n# the last ping received from the slave, that is usually sent every second.\n#\n# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but\n# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough slaves\n# are available, to the specified number of seconds.\n#\n# For example to require at least 3 slaves with a lag \u003c= 10 seconds use:\n#\n# min-slaves-to-write 3\n# min-slaves-max-lag 10\n#\n# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.\n#\n# By default min-slaves-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and\n# min-slaves-max-lag is set to 10.\n\n################################## SECURITY ###################################\n\n# Require clients to issue AUTH \u003cPASSWORD\u003e before processing any other\n# commands.

By default\n# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not\n# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit\n# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit\n# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).\n#\n# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending\n# an error 'max number of clients reached'.\n#\n# maxclients 10000\n\n# Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes.\n# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys\n# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).\n#\n# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is\n# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands\n# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue\n# to reply to read-only commands like GET.\n#\n# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU cache, or to set\n# a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).\n#\n# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,\n# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted\n# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will\n# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output\n# buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion\n# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.\n#\n# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower\n# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave\n# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').\n#\n# maxmemory \u003cbytes\u003e\n\n# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory\n# is reached.

This mode is\n# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or\n# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on\n# the configured save points).\n#\n# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides\n# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy\n# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a\n# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something\n# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is\n# still running correctly.\n#\n# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.\n# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file\n# with the better durability guarantees.\n#\n# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.\n\nappendonly yes\n\n# The name of the append only file (default: \"appendonly.aof\")\n\nappendfilename \"appendonly.aof\"\n\n# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk\n# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush\n# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.\n#\n# Redis supports three different modes:\n#\n# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.\n# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.\n# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.\n#\n# The default is \"everysec\", as that's usually the right compromise between\n# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to\n# \"no\" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when\n# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of\n# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),\n# or on the contrary, use \"always\" that's very slow but a bit safer than\n# everysec.\n#\n# More details please check the following article:\n# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html\n#\n# If unsure, use \"everysec\".\n\n# appendfsync always\nappendfsync everysec\n# appendfsync no\n\n# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background\n# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is\n# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations\n# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for\n# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block\n# our synchronous write(2) call.\n#\n# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option\n# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a\n# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.\n#\n# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is\n# the same as \"appendfsync none\". In practical terms, this means that it is\n# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the\n# default Linux settings).\n#\n# If you have latency problems turn this to \"yes\". Otherwise leave it as\n# \"no\" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.\n\nno-appendfsync-on-rewrite no\n\n# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.\n# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling\n# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.\n#\n# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the\n# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of\n# the AOF at startup is used).\n#\n# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is\n# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also\n# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this\n# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase\n# is reached but it is still pretty small.\n#\n# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF\n# rewrite feature.\n\nauto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100\nauto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb\n\n# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis\n# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.\n# This may happen when the system where Redis is running\n# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the\n# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself\n# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).\n#\n# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much\n# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found\n# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.\n#\n# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and\n# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.\n# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error\n# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires\n# to fix the AOF file using the \"redis-check-aof\" utility before to restart\n# the server.\n#\n# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle\n# the server will still exit with an error.

The first can be\n# used to stop a script that did not yet called write commands. The second\n# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write command was\n# already issued by the script but the user doesn't want to wait for the natural\n# termination of the script.\n#\n# Set it to 0 or a negative value for unlimited execution without warnings.\nlua-time-limit 5000\n\n################################## SLOW LOG ###################################\n\n# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified\n# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations\n# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,\n# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only\n# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve\n# other requests in the meantime).\n#\n# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis\n# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the\n# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the\n# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the\n# queue of logged commands.\n\n# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent\n# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while\n# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.\nslowlog-log-slower-than 10000\n\n# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.\n# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.\nslowlog-max-len 128\n\n################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################\n\n# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations\n# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of\n# latency of a Redis instance.\n#\n# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can\n# print graphs and obtain reports.\n#\n# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or\n# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the\n# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set\n# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.\n#\n# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed\n# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance\n# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency\n# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command\n# \"CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold \u003cmilliseconds\u003e\" if needed.\nlatency-monitor-threshold 0\n\n############################# Event notification ##############################\n\n# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.\n# This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications\n#\n# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client\n# performs a DEL operation on key \"foo\" stored in the Database 0, two\n# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:\n#\n# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del\n# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo\n#\n# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set\n# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:\n#\n#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@\u003cdb\u003e__ prefix.\n#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@\u003cdb\u003e__ prefix.\n#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...\n#  $     String commands\n#  l     List commands\n#  s     Set commands\n#  h     Hash commands\n#  z     Sorted set commands\n#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)\n#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)\n#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the \"AKE\" string means all the events.\n#\n#  The \"notify-keyspace-events\" takes as argument a string that is composed\n#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications\n#  are disabled.\n#\n#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the\n#           event name, use:\n#\n#  notify-keyspace-events Elg\n#\n#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel\n#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:\n#\n#  notify-keyspace-events Ex\n#\n#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need\n#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't\n#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.\nnotify-keyspace-events \"\"\n\n############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################\n\n# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a\n# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given\n# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.\nhash-max-ziplist-entries 512\nhash-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# Similarly to hashes, small lists are also encoded in a special way in order\n# to save a lot of space. The special representation is only used when\n# you are under the following limits:\nlist-max-ziplist-entries 512\nlist-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed\n# of just strings that happen to be integers in radix 10 in the range\n# of 64 bit signed integers.\n# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the\n# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.\nset-max-intset-entries 512\n\n# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in\n# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and\n# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:\nzset-max-ziplist-entries 128\nzset-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# HyperLogLog sparse representation bytes limit. The limit includes the\n# 16 bytes header. When an HyperLogLog using the sparse representation crosses\n# this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.\n#\n# A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the\n# dense representation is more memory efficient.\n#\n# The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of\n# the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,\n# which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to\n# ~ 10000 when CPU is not a concern, but space is, and the data set is\n# composed of many HyperLogLogs with cardinality in the 0 - 15000 range.\nhll-sparse-max-bytes 3000\n\n# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in\n# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level\n# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)\n# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table\n# that is rehashing, the more rehashing \"steps\" are performed, so if the\n# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used\n# by the hash table.\n#\n# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to\n# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.\n#\n# If unsure:\n# use \"activerehashing no\" if you have hard latency requirements and it is\n# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time\n# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.\n#\n# use \"activerehashing yes\" if you don't have such hard requirements but\n# want to free memory asap when possible.\nactiverehashing yes\n\n# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients\n# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a\n# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the\n# publisher can produce them).\n#\n# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:\n#\n# normal -\u003e normal clients including MONITOR clients\n# slave  -\u003e slave clients\n# pubsub -\u003e clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern\n#\n# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:\n#\n# client-output-buffer-limit \u003cclass\u003e \u003chard limit\u003e \u003csoft limit\u003e \u003csoft seconds\u003e\n#\n# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if\n# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of\n# seconds (continuously).\n# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is\n# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately\n# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get\n# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes\n# the limit for 10 seconds.\n#\n# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data\n# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only\n# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster\n# than it can read.\n#\n# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since\n# subscribers and slaves receive data in a push fashion.\n#\n# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.\nclient-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0\nclient-output-buffer-limit slave 256mb 64mb 60\nclient-output-buffer-limit pubsub 32mb 8mb 60\n\n# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like\n# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are\n# never requested, and so forth.\n#\n# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for\n# tasks to perform according to the specified \"hz\" value.\n#\n# By default \"hz\" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when\n# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when\n# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be\n# handled with more precision.\n#\n# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not\n# a good idea.
